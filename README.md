this is supposed too be some sort of fake windows xp machine. it is in no way owned by microsoft except for the background image. 
even though it should seem like a windows machine it should be about me.

maybe ill add some easter eggs
## why?
i grew up on windows XP and it is what started my obsession with tech.
